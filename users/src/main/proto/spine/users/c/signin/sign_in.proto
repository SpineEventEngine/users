// The process of a sign-in by the given authentication identity.
//
// This process manager covers a straighforward sign-in scenario:
//
// 1. `SignUserIn` command initializes the sign-in process.
// 2. If a `User` aggregate with the given ID already exists all checks pass the `SignInSuccessful`
//    event is generated in response.
// 3. Otherwise, the process manager creates a `User` aggregate and then attempts to `SignUserIn`
//    again.
//
// To sign a user in, the process manager ensures the following:
//
// 1. an identity provider is aware of the given authentication identity;
// 2. an identity provider authorize the user to sign in (e.g. the opposite would be if the user
//    account was suspended);
// 3. the given authentication identity is associated with the user (please see `AddAuthIdentity`
//    command).
//
// If one of the checks fails, the process is completed immediately with `SignInFailed` event.
