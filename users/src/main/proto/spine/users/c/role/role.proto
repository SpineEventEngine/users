// A role that can be assigned to `Users` and `Groups`, to peform access control.
//
// Roles are assigned to `Users` and `Group` directly and explicitly (please, see `AssignRoleToUser`,
// `AssignRoleFromUser` commands). A `Role` exists in the scope of an organization or an orgunit,
// therefore it can be assigned only to those `Users` and `Groups` that are in the same organization
// and/or orgunit (or their child orgunits).
//
// ## Access Control
//
// The roles assigned to a `Group` are recursively propagated to all members of a group.
// This propagation is implicit and doesn't affect an aggegate state in any way.
//
// Therefore, when carrying out role-based access control, consider that a `User` or a `Group`
// has not only the roles listed in the aggregate state, but effectively all the roles derived from
// parent groups.
//
// ## Case Study
//
// Here is a simple case study to facilitate understanding of the roles.
// Consider the following organizational structure:
//
// ```
//          Chips & Cookies            <-- Organization
//            /          \
//      Accounting   Cookie Factory    <-- OrgUnit
//          /   \         \
//         /   John Doe  Jack Jackson  <-- User
//        /
//  external_auditors                  <-- Group
//       |
//   Jane Smith                        <-- User
// ```
//
// Here are the statements about "Chips & Cookies" that will help you gain intuition on
// how to apply roles in your application:
//
// 1. If `office-visitor` role belongs to "Chips & Cookies" organization it can be assigned to any
//    user or group depicted above.
// 2. If `color-printer-user` role belongs to "Accounting" orgunit it can be assigned only to
//    John Doe, Jane Smith, and `external_audior` group.
// 3. If `bank-account-reader` role is assigned to `external_auditors` group, Jane Smith as a member
//    of the group effectively has the role too.
// 4. If `3rd-floor-visitor` role is assigned to Jane Smith, she effectively has both this role
//    and all roles from `external_auditors` group.
// 5. Jack Jackson can't be assigned `color-printer-user` role because it is from another
//    organizational unit.
