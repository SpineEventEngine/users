// A `Group` is a way to group users by their common functions and functional roles inside of
// an organization or organizational unit.
//
// The roles, assigned to a `Group` are implicitly inherited by all members of the group,
// including sub-groups.
//
// ## Usage Example
//
// For example, a software development department of a company may well have the following groups:
//
// * Developers
//      ```
//      {
//          display_name: "Developers",
//          email: "developers@department.company.com",
//          role: ["github-contributor", "test-server-admin"],
//      }
//      ```
// * Support Engineers
//      ```
//      {
//          display_name: "Support Team",
//          email: "support@department.company.com",
//          role: ["bugtracker-contributor"],
//      }
//      ```
